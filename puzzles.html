      You and five friends decide to work on a jigsaw puzzle. The 1,000 piece
      puzzle has 50 rows and 20 columns. Each player begins with a random set of
      200 pieces, puzzling them as best as they can. After all possible moves
      are made, we are left with single pieces and matched pieces (both of which
      count as one piece). These are then evenly redistributed at random among
      the players, and the process repeats. How many rounds must be played
      before less than 30% of the pieces have no match?

    <div class="puzzle-answer-1">
      When I first approached this problem, I took a statistical approach.
      Having little success, I decided to code a simulation and run some tests.
      I've often found that a quick simulation yields large returns when
      attempting a closed-form solution regarding difficult probability
      problems. If you're interested in the code, it can be found on my GitHub.
      This puzzle in particular lends itself to some beautiful artwork, so lets
      get to it!

    <div class="puzzle-section">Method</div>
    <div class="puzzle-answer-1">
      We can represent the puzzle using a \(50 \times 20\) array, where each
      entry in the array corresponds to ownership by a certain player. Using
      this as our model, we then employ the following steps to create some
      puzzle-logic, and then our game itself,
      <ol>
        <li>
          Build a dictionary whose keys represent the coordinates of each piece
          in the array, and when a specific piece is called, returns a list of
          possible connectors.
          <i>Numpy</i> makes this task relatively easy through array indexing,
          though it can get a little tricky thinking about edge/corner pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assign ownership to all of the puzzle pieces at random. Though our
          specific problem concerns a \(50 \times 20\) array, we might as well
          create a program for the general case of an \(n \times m\) array. Each
          of \(p\) players can be represented by a value, \(1,...,p\). We can
          assign these values equally throughout the array, and then shuffle it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now we iterate through the positions of every piece, and use the
          dictionary and array we created to determine whether a connection is
          possible (pieces must be adjacent and have the same owner). Every
          piece then has an associated list of connectors. We save all of these
          lists with reference to which player “owns” them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now we have something like a network! Every player has a list of
          sublists, and each sublist represents a piece along with its (maximum
          four) connectors. We can use <i>NetworkX</i> to join lists which share
          any common elements, and therefore every player is left with lists
          representing contiguous sets of pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          All that's left now is to throw all the new pieces back into the pot,
          and redistribute them as evenly as possible. We then create a new
          ownership array, and repeat steps 3-5 as many times as we like. Once
          only \(p\) pieces remain, we consider the puzzle complete.
        </li>
      </ol>

      As promised: the best part is the art. We can now visualize the resulting
      puzzle as it is collectively solved by the puzzlers. Each shade of
      blue-grey represents a specific player's pieces. As shown below, the
      rounds progress from left to right, top to bottom, with the system's
      entropy dropping from frame to frame. The first frame appears completely
      unordered, like the static on a TV screen, while the last possesses mostly
      large, bulky pieces.

      This graphic does not reveal "completion," however. The end state of any
      puzzle under this model contains exactly \(p\) pieces, so in this case,
      five. We now can run a simulation of 1,000 puzzles, each with ten rounds,
      and record the proportion of single pieces at the end of each round. While
      we're at it, we might as well try some puzzles of different sizes
